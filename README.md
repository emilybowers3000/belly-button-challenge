Belly Button Challenge

Project Description
The Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard is an interactive web application designed to explore and visualize microbial biodiversity data collected from human belly buttons. This project aims to provide users with an engaging and informative experience by presenting various charts and visualizations based on the dataset. For reference, a operational taxonomic units (OTUs) are a concept used in microbial ecology and DNA sequencing analysis to classify and quantify similar sequences of genetic material, typically from bacteria, archaea, or fungi.(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_taxonomic_unit)

The main features of the dashboard include:

Dropdown Menu: Users can select different test subject IDs from the dropdown menu to view the corresponding data for each individual.

Horizontal Bar Chart: Displays the top 10 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) found in the selected individual, with their sample values as bar lengths. The OTU IDs are used as labels, and the OTU labels provide additional information on hover.

Bubble Chart: Visualizes all the OTUs present in the selected individual, with their sample values determining the size of the markers. The OTU IDs are used as marker colors, and the OTU labels are displayed as text on hover.

Demographic Information: Displays the demographic information of the selected individual, including key-value pairs such as age, gender, ethnicity, etc.

Technologies Used: The project utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for frontend development. D3.js and Plotly.js libraries are used for data visualization, while Bootstrap framework ensures responsiveness and styling.

This dashboard serves as an educational tool to explore the fascinating (and sometimes gross) world of microbial diversity residing in the human body, specifically in belly buttons. Users can gain insights into the composition of microbial communities and understand the variation in microbial profiles across different individuals. Additionally, the project encourages further exploration and analysis of microbiome data for scientific research and public awareness.
